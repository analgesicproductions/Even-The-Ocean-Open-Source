Adapted from Anodyne's source code license, itself adapted from VVVVVV's. This is NOT an Open Source license (though it's still fairly free) - read for details. If you think something ought to be changed reach out to Melos Han-Tani at hello@analgesic.productions

- Non-legal summary of license: Anyone can use or compile the code EVEN WITHOUT OWNING THE GAME. The code is open to everyone. If you're doing noncommercial or commercial things with a low budget ( < $50k/year), you can do anything, so long as you credit us. Don't sell anything unaltered (don't sell our sprites or music unaltered, or compile and try to sell the game unaltered.)

If you are interested in distributing work that falls outside the terms in the license below, or if you are interested in distributing work that includes using any part of Even the Ocean not included in this repo then please get in touch - we can discuss granting a license for that on a case by case basis.

Even the Ocean License v1.0
Last updated September 23rd, 2023

This notice may not be removed or altered from any source, binary or asset distribution.

This repo contains the source code for Even the Ocean, including all level, art, music, sound, and text content from the game.

For the purposes of the below license "GAME" will refer to "Even the Ocean".

The license contains two parts, pertaining to the source code assets, and then level/art/music/sound/text assets separately.



General Restrictions
----------

No resale or distribution of unaltered game

- You may not alter or redistribute any **unaltered** versions of GAME in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to, selling unaltered versions of this software, or including advertisements of any kind in unaltered versions of this software.  
- You may not redistribute **unaltered** GAME for free.
- "Unaltered" means any version of GAME where 90% of the average playtime contains significantly similar content to the GAME (meaning you can't tint the sprite colors or change what Aliph looks like and call that an "altered" version.)
- Any project utilizing the Asset Library or Code must include "LICENSE_FOR_DERIVATIVES.md" in the project.

On mods

- Mods must contain wording somewhere (download page, title screen, credits) to indicate the mod is not the original version of GAME.
- As a general, non-legally-binding guideline: 'small' mods (60 FPS, 'faster engine',  'funny filters') should be free. "Medium" mods (harder levels, remixed dungeons) should be free. "Large" mods (totally new level and world layouts, brand new dialogue) can be sold (even if it has no different art/music assets.) Because this is so legally grey I'm not enforcing this, but please be respectful and use your best judgment when it comes to charging money for mods.

Part 1: GAME Asset Library (Art, Level, Music, Sound, Text assets)
-------------

The Asset Library of GAME consists of all files in this repository EXCEPT: .bat, .py , .hx, and .sh files (source code).

GAME's Asset Library is free to be used for most purposes (commercial/noncommercial fangames, mods, etc), but:

The Asset Library for GAME falls under a CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with the additional restrictions. For clarity (and to make explicit we are not claiming the asset library is under a CC license), the asset library does NOT fall under a "CC BY 4.0" license, but a mixture of the CC BY 4.0 terms and the following restrictions:


- To use these assets you DO NOT NEED TO OWN THE GAME. That being said, as we still rely on GAME sales for our livelihood, please purchase a copy if you can! Also it's kind of hard to compile Even the Ocean, so buying the game might be easier. Ha ha.
- The assets may not be used for for-profit purposes for budgets over $50,000 USD/year, or a commercial project with potential lifetime gross of over $50,000 USD: if either of these are true, you must contact us on a case-by-case basis to discuss licensing fees and royalties. This is mainly here to protect us against our work being used freely by extremely wealthy companies and the like - if you're a small solo developer or small team, we don't want to restrict you. 
- You may not use any of the assets in a way that would infringe upon the GAME game copyright by creating a product that may be mistaken for GAME (e.g. you may not compile the unaltered game and rename it "Even's The Ocean" and sell it).
- You may not redistribute any of the unaltered assets in standalone packages, in a way primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This includes but is not limited to: selling the art in 'asset packages', selling the music on music distribution platforms.
- You may not redistribute any of the unaltered assets for free without prior written permission (e.g., you may not create a "GAME Sprites" itch.io product page. Use your best judgment: if the edits you're making are not significantly different, you shouldn't redistribute it for free (e.g. tinting spritesheet slightly)). If you're not sure, please reach out to us and ask.
- Any COMMERCIAL, derivative work using these assets must include an acknowledgement visible to all users of the product (e.g. title screen of a game or game's store page) that it includes used assets that are copyright of Analgesic Productions LLC and are from the GAME asset library.
- The origin of these assets must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you created the original assets.

Basically don't resell our stuff as if it was yours, and make sure to give credit where it's due!
